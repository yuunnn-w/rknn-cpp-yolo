# rknn-cpp-yolo
This project implements YOLOv11 inference on the RK3588 platform using the RKNN framework. With deep optimization of the official code and RGA hardware acceleration for image preprocessing, it achieves a stable 25 FPS for YOLOv11s without overclocking or core binding, showcasing efficient real-time object detection for embedded applications.
